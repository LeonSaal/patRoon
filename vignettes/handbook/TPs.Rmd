# Transformation product screening

A _transformation product_ (TP) is a chemical that was produced from a _parent_ chemical, for instance, as a result of chemical or biological processes. Screening of transformation products has various important applications, such as evaluating the environmental impact of TPs when formed in the environment or water treatment processes and studying how drugs are metabolized.

Performing non-target screening of TPs brings complexity, since ...


## Obtaining transformation product data

### Processing data

### Custom libraries and transformations

## Linking parent and transformation product features

### Componentization

### Processing data

### Without transformation product input

## Example workflows

### Screen predicted TPs for targets

### Screening library TPs for suspects

### Non-targeted screening of predicted TPs
