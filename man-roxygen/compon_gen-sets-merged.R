#' @section Sets workflows: In a \link[=sets-workflow]{sets workflow} the componentization is first performed for each
#'   set independently. The resulting components are then all combined in a \code{\link{<%=class%>}} object. Note that
#'   the components themselves are never merged. The components are renamed to include the set name from which they were
#'   generated (\emph{e.g.} \code{"CMP1"} becomes \code{"CMP1-positive"}).
